# ISP_PUPPET_SHOW_MASTER ðŸ¤¡ðŸŽ­ðŸŽª

**Purpose:**  
This upgraded version of the "ISP Spooky Freak Them Off" script takes things to the next level! Turn your ISP into your puppet, guiding them through a carnival of nonsense as they try to figure out what you're really doing online. Itâ€™s a hypnotic show theyâ€™ll never escape.

## Features
1. **Puppet Show Madness**: Simultaneously opens random websites from your curated list to create an illusion of chaotic activity.
2. **Variable Delays**: Adds an extra layer of randomness with unpredictable link-opening intervals, like a hypnotist snapping their fingers.
3. **Multithreading**: Employs multiple threads to ensure that the ISPâ€™s confusion reaches new heights.
4. **Endless Fun**: Let the show go on forever or stop it manually. The ISP will be dancing until the curtains fall.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Prepare the Puppet Stage**:  
   Create a text file named `Spooky.txt` in the script's directory and add URLs for the ISP puppets to visit. Example:  
https://thepuppetmaster.net https://confusedisp.com https://chaosforever.org

2. **Run the Hypnotist's Script**:  
Execute the script from your terminal:
```bash
python ISP_PUPPET_SHOW_MASTER.py
What Happens?
Your ISP will be drawn into a digital circus where every thread spins a new illusion. Imagine them staring at their logs:

"Why is this user watching cat videos, then reading about quantum physics, then switching to cooking tutorials all at once?"
"Waitâ€¦ are they shopping for inflatable unicorns now?!"
"I canâ€™t keep up!"
Itâ€™s the ultimate confusion spell for snooping ISPs addicted to tracking your moves. ðŸŽ­
Hypnotist's Disclaimer
